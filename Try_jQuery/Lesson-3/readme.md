When the page loads, we'll show a message to the traveler letting them know how to book this trip. To start out, let's create a <span> node with our phone number, 1-555-jquery-air and set it to the message variable.

##3.4 Adding to the DOM I

Let's add the phone number immediately before() the "Book Now" button. You can check out the HTML of the rendered page by clicking on the HTML tab below.

##3.5 Adding to the DOM II

On second thought, maybe we should append() our <span> to the bottom of the .usa element. Let's change the code to add it there instead.
